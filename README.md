# Metabolic Syndrome Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence of *Metabolic Syndrome* using clinical and demographic health data through both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches.

## Project Description

The project is divided into two main parts.  
The first part involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, correlation mapping, feature selection, and training traditional machine learning models for binary classification.  
The second part applies deep learning techniques on the same dataset, including a binary neural network and a sequential model, followed by model evaluation and comparison.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of metabolic syndrome at an early stage, supporting data-driven insights for prevention and improved healthcare decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Keras  
- Google Colab
